            <strong>Augmented reality (AR)</strong> is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).</p> 
        <p>
            This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.

        <h3>Why do we need AR ?</h3>
        <p>
            Think of a time when you have more than four software windows open and while switching between them your 'not so good' laptop stops responding completely. If you are on windows then even your task manager might not pick up your call. This is a pretty regular scene if you are from the IT industry. Now image if AR replaces your display. Then you have all your windows laid out right in front of you. It would be super cool! right? You don't have to keep switching between apps, you won't need extra monitors and your productivity will increase exponentially.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike with VR, AR allows us flexibility. The device doesn’t have to produce a completely immersive world to interact with, because it uses our own. It takes the data of our existing surroundings and solves a problem we have. Now you might be asking what that problem is, but that depends. You can solve a variety of problems that require solutions and AR allows you to do that. Because AR devices don’t always require high performing hardware we can use technology as small as your day to day glasses!
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason we need augmented reality is because the world is constantly changing. We need something flexible that provides solutions to everyday problems that are becoming ever more complex. With that being said, there are several industries that can benefit or are already using the technology!
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies used in AR</h3>
        <p>
            Various technologies are used in augmented reality rendering, including optical projection systems, HMDs, smartglasses, handheld devices, and display systems, which can be worn on the human body.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <strong>head-mounted display (HMD)</strong> is a display device worn on the forehead, such as a harness or helmet-mounted HMDs place images of both the physical world and virtual objects over the user's field of view. Modern HMDs often employ sensors for six degrees of freedom monitoring that allow the system to align virtual information to the physical world and adjust accordingly with the user's head movements. HMDs can provide VR users with mobile and collaborative experiences. Specific providers, such as uSens and Gestigon, include gesture controls for full virtual immersion.

        <h3>Utility of AR</h3>
        <p>
            Leveraging the utility of AR in real world problems is a vast chapter in itself. It has been highly beneficial in STEM education and research. Use of AR in IT industry, Engineering, Architecture and Construction, Medical Science etc. have eased work pressure, made work more fun and have boosted productivity. Due to this the demand for AR integration in various fields is rising. Thus, it can be comfortably stated that a lot of people around us will be using <strong>AR headsets</strong> like we use smartphones today in the next  three to four years.</p>
